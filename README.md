# Sales-prediction-Model-Lstm-D-L-small-Data
The LSTM model is a serial model. Following my small data economic 
I am trying to produce series where time is important, 
I am looking to preserve the time. Since that sequences arrangement is
important.I note that I have not been able to preserve the time component
because of the data structure and economic definitions aspects that do not 
allow me to complete missing cells just like that, with no meaning. When this
is the case!! And after all, the problems I check is an economic question - 
the prediction was done in two ways and if each one of them gives me the 
same answer I know I overcame the problem of the schedule. 
To appoint we have 2 problems: 
1) time schedule and data structure, 
2) Small data? 
    These are the two main problems are inquering and solving in the economic
data structure I have on the hands. And the question is: will we be able to 
get a prediction despite both problems for those I test it in Pearson as well 
as in deep? And after all I get a model that converges, and accuracy ranges are 
from 83% -93%. More of that I check if there is a single variable, a feature 
that could give me a prediction (I did not find), and further check if all the 
variables together being in synergy each one to other, they together can give 
me a prediction, and here I see that together, only together I get a moving 
prediction picture that is Between 83% -93%. It is true that when time misorder
the value of the LSTM is eroded. I hope it's clearer now. Yet in 
the economics worlds, there are quite a few problems and approximations that 
were done to fit problems and this LSTM approximation economically - 
is right to be done.
